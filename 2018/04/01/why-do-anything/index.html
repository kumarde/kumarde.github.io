        <p>I recently had a great conversation with a friend, <a href="jminjie.com">Jordan Liu</a><br>about art and why we choose to make it.  </p>
<p>Context: For the last year or so, Jordan and I have been working on a musical.<br>As we were wrapping up our writing session for the day, we got into a<br>conversation about what we were going to do with it once it was “finished”.<br>Neither of us have “sold” a lengthy project like a musical before, so we spent<br>some time discussing how easy or difficult we thought that process would be. </p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="external">this idea</a>, Jordan<br>suggested he would be more satisfied if we reached 1000 true fans that would<br>“spend $100 on us” rather than reaching a million people who were less<br>invested. At first, I thought that this was totally at odds with my idea about<br>where I wanted the musical to go. In my mind, there was no question. Of course<br>I would prefer one million people to engage with my art over 1000 people! Who<br>wouldn’t?</p>
<p>Then, Jordan really got me thinking. What good would it do if a million people<br>saw our story but got nothing from it? Wouldn’t it actually be much better to<br>have 1000 people who it truly, deeply impacted? After all, we make art to do<br>just that - engage with people as humans, not as numbers. Well, wait. Now I’m<br>confused. Why is it that I make art? </p>
<p>Typically, the reasons for why I work on something is because I think it can<br>change the world (yes, I understand that sounds naive and silly, but it’s how I<br>think about things!) Well, in what ways can art change the world? It could<br>certainly entertain people. That’s one way. But does that really help “move the<br>needle forward” on the things that plague our society today, like too many mass<br>shootings or racial injustice? Probably not. However, I do like to tell myself<br>that it <em>can</em> help, maybe in ways that are unseen. </p>
<p>Take the example of the TV show “Atlanta”. To me, Atlanta is a delightfully<br>humanist look into the lives of black people <em>just living</em>. This is a<br>remarkably simple idea, but one with so much power - in my mind, if Atlanta can<br>build empathy with average Americans about how black people live and go<br>through relatable struggles, maybe, just maybe, <em>that</em> will improve race<br>relations in this country. But of course, saying that out loud makes me feel<br>like a total idiot. Of course TV can’t fix racism. Suggesting that it can<br>trivializes hundreds of years of brutal mistreatment of PoCs in this country.</p>
<p>Back to the question. If my art doesn’t <em>really</em> help anyone, then what’s the<br>point? Why do I insist that it must be created, engaged with, seen, critiqued,<br>and made better? Part of me knows it’s honestly just because I find it fun, and<br>we all like doing things that are fun for us. Another part of me yearns for<br>there to be a deeper reason. Who knows? I haven’t figured it out yet. In the<br>meanwhile, I’ll keep making stuff. Maybe someday it’ll <em>really</em> change the<br>world.</p>
