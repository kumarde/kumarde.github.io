        <p>The following post has <strong><em>MAJOR</em></strong> spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War.<br>Do not read if you haven’t seen the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War was a real treat. I found myself highly enjoying the<br>action, the humor, and the last ten years of superheroes all sharing the screen<br>together. </p>
<p>Though there were lots of parts I loved about the movie, what makes the story<br>especially excellent is Thanos. Here is a villain for whom most MCU fans have<br>been patiently waiting since we saw glimpses of him at the end of the first<br>Avengers film. And yet, in Infinity War, it isn’t his <em>villainy</em> that makes him<br>a powerful adversary (though he <em>is</em> an excellent villain). Instead, it’s how<br>the screenwriters, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, walk us through the<br>narrative from <em>Thanos’</em> perspective, giving us emotional insight that has<br>previously only been ascribed to the heroes in this universe. Reminding us what<br>Thanos has had to lose in order to achieve his goal of eliminating half the<br>universe to end suffering makes his plight all that more relatable.<br>In my opinion, it makes him the protagonist. </p>
<p>In most conventional stories on screen, you can follow the main character<br>through something called the “Hero’s Journey”: this is the cycle of events that<br>drive the plot and make the character who they are. Dan Harmon, the<br>screenwriter behind Commmunity, lays it out in 8 simple steps<br><a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A character is in a zone of comfort,</li>
<li>But they want something.</li>
<li>They enter an unfamiliar situation,</li>
<li>Adapt to it,</li>
<li>Get what they wanted,</li>
<li>Pay a heavy price for it,</li>
<li>Then return to their familiar situation,</li>
<li>Having changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I found was remarkable in this story is that there’s really only one<br>character who experiences a full journey of this kind so explicitly: Thanos.<br>Thanos exists in the universe, but he’s plagued by the suffering he saw<br>overpopulation bring to his home. Driven by this, he travels to planets around<br>the universe, non-discrimantly killing half the inhabitants in an act of what<br>he deems as charity. But it’s brutal, and Thanos himself acknowledges it. What<br>he wants is a <em>merciful</em> way to eliminate half the universe. And so begins his<br>quest to collect all of the Infinity Stones—together, they can remove half<br>the universe with the snap of a finger. It’s mercy, he says. </p>
<p>To do so, he needs to fight off a whole new set of adversaries: The Avengers<br>(and friends). Thanos is all powerful, but that doesn’t stop the Avengers from<br>getting in a couple of pretty awesome beatdowns. This is something he needs to<br>learn how to adapt to.  The really important part, however, is not just<br>figuring out how to beat the crap out of each of the avengers, but instead, how<br>identifying how to to acquire the soul stone, which hadn’t appeared in any<br>previous movies. In order to do so, he learns, he must sacrifice something he<br>truly loves. A soul for a soul. </p>
<p>Through this sacrifice, we see not only the price that Thanos must pay<br>(everything, as he succinctly says at the end of the movie), but also his<br>fundamental character change. He is wraught with anguish and grief at the<br>thought of killing his daughter in his plight to save the universe. However, he<br>proclaims that he has turned from his destiny before (he was not strong enough<br>to do something like this in the psat) and that he will not let that happen<br>again (he has changed). He kills Gamora, receiving the soul<br>stone in return, putting him steady on the path to Universal annihilation.<br>By the end of the movie, he’s returned back to the universe, having changed,<br>and succeeding in his major goal.</p>
<p>As far as stories go, this is actually pretty basic. It follows very closely<br>what an audience would expect to happen. But the <em>reason</em> it’s shocking is<br>because Thanos isn’t the “hero”. He’s the villain. And this is what brings me<br>back to why I think this movie was excellent—the filmmakers subverted my<br>expectations through the entire movie by making a movie that was actually not<br>about the Avengers at all, but instead about a distraught Titan simply trying<br>to make right in the universe.</p>
