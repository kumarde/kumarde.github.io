        <p>My advisor told me yesterday my academic writing was annoying. In a quest to<br>be a better writer, I am mostly documenting this as a set of notes for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t try too hard. I am a mega culprit of this, and often use words that,<br>while they sound cool, offer little meaning to the sentence.</li>
<li>Never overstate. Science is about just presenting what you’ve done. </li>
<li>Verb choice is really important.</li>
<li>Stop using passive voice. I use lots of passive voice in my first drafts of<br>things, and it just leads to bad writing. Utilize the “by zombies” trick when you<br>are in doubt. (<a href="http://auwritingcenter.blogspot.com/2012/10/identify-passive-voice-with-zombies.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://auwritingcenter.blogspot.com/2012/10/identify-passive-voice-with-zombies.html</a>)</li>
<li>Avoid statements that don’t add anything. In the context of a paper about social media being used to<br>identify disinformation campsigns, a sentence like “Social media is the new frontier for disinformation campaigns”<br>is a terrible sentence. It doesn’t add anything to the writing.</li>
</ol>

        <p>I just submitted the last paper that I started during my first year, so I am<br>officially deeming my first year as done. Now that it’s over, I’m writing<br>this down to reflect on how the year has gone, and hope that my musings may<br>help you (the reader) as you navigate your first year as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Imposter syndrome is real. It takes a long time to get used to being “in charge”<br>of research and being an academic peer that professors will listen to. Don’t let it<br>hamper your curiosity.</li>
<li>Find an advisor that you can be friends with. Some people prefer<br>“professional relationships with their advisor”—but I can’t imagine what my first<br>year would be like if my advisor wasn’t the weirdest, cookiest friend I’ve ever met.</li>
<li>Make friends with your labmates. If they are shy, force them to be your friend.<br>A good group culture leads to better discussions which leads to better ideas and<br>as a result, better research. It’s only been one year, but I’m happy to call my lab<br>mates my close friends.</li>
<li>Show up in the lab, even if you aren’t doing anything valuable. You learn a lot<br>from others in your lab by just being there, and it sets up a good habit for<br>when you are going to be doing this all the time in future years.</li>
<li>Tell your advisor you want to start on research immediately. You never know<br>what projects are just sitting around waiting for people to do things on them.</li>
<li>(Controversial, I think) Pay attention only in the classes that matter to your<br>research, and do the minimum for everything else. More time on task for research<br>is the most important thing.</li>
<li>Jump on as many things as you can. Failure is okay, especially in your first<br>year. Find your breaking point, then adjust. </li>
<li>Have fun. Research is supposed to be fun, and so is grad school.</li>
</ol>
