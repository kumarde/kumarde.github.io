        <p>It’s almost December, so it’s about that time that people kick<br>it into high gear to apply to graduate school. I’ve had a few of my<br>close friends reach out to me and ask me to review their statements of<br>purpose, to which I told them they were crazy for trusting me to know<br>such a thing. But then again, that’s what I did two years ago to my<br>2nd year PhD friends, so maybe it’s not so crazy. I’m writing this to<br>compile a list of thoughts I had on writing statement for graduate school<br>applications.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The “Statement of Purpose” is aptly named - it is a statement of<br>your purpose. What is it that you want to do? And implicit to<br>that question, <em>why</em> is it that you want to do it? Consider this<br>as your thesis statement for your argument. For example, “I want to do a PhD<br>so I can become a professor that does research in X”. Alternatively,<br>“I want to do an MS to position myself better for Y job”. Every sentence<br>you write afterwards needs to build to that point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t tell people that you’ve been in love with your subject since you were<br>a young lassie (really, I’ve read something like this). It’s cliche and<br>people will instantly throw your statement away. Get right to the point<br>and state your purpose in the first sentence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware that most statements get looked at for maybe 3 minutes, max.<br>There are a lot of great applicants, and professors have fairly limited<br>time. You want to make sure that if someone is skimming your statement<br>quickly, they can pull out the important points fairly easily. I like<br>to do this by having the first sentence of each paragraph immediately say<br>what the point of that paragraph will be, without forcing the reader to tease<br>out the details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Mostly for Research Statements:</em> Make sure it is clear what you want to<br>do research in. Level 1 is simply saying you want to do research. Level 2 is<br>putting in some work to ask a few questions about the research that you’d like to<br>do. Level 3 is when you have done a deep literature dive and found a problem<br>area specifically that you want to tackle. That is awesome, but by no means required<br>(I got <em>barely</em> to Level 2 in my statements). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, these are some guidelines for writing a good SoP. I’m attaching the SoP I<br>wrote for graduate school here, primarily because I found that there was a lack of<br>SoPs available when I was applying to graduate school in CS. I have tons of other<br>thoughts that I don’t have time to write down here, so I’ll just leave it at that.<br>If you have questions, feel free to email me at dkumar11@illinois.edu. </p>
