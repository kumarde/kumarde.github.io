        <p>It’s almost December, so it’s about that time that people kick<br>it into high gear to apply to graduate school. I’ve had a few of my<br>close friends reach out to me and ask me to review their statements of<br>purpose, to which I told them they were crazy for trusting me to know<br>such a thing. But then again, that’s what I did two years ago to my<br>2nd year PhD friends, so maybe it’s not so crazy. I’m writing this to<br>compile a list of thoughts I had on writing statement for graduate school<br>applications.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The “Statement of Purpose” is aptly named - it is a statement of<br>your purpose. What is it that you want to do? And implicit to<br>that question, <em>why</em> is it that you want to do it? Consider this<br>as your thesis statement for your argument. For example, “I want to do a PhD<br>so I can become a professor that does research in X”. Alternatively,<br>“I want to do an MS to position myself better for Y job”. Every sentence<br>you write afterwards needs to build to that point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t tell people that you’ve been in love with your subject since you were<br>a young lassie (really, I’ve read something like this). It’s cliche and<br>people will instantly throw your statement away. Get right to the point<br>and state your purpose in the first sentence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware that most statements get looked at for maybe 3 minutes, max.<br>There are a lot of great applicants, and professors have fairly limited<br>time. You want to make sure that if someone is skimming your statement<br>quickly, they can pull out the important points fairly easily. I like<br>to do this by having the first sentence of each paragraph immediately say<br>what the point of that paragraph will be, without forcing the reader to tease<br>out the details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Mostly for Research Statements:</em> Make sure it is clear what you want to<br>do research in. Level 1 is simply saying you want to do research. Level 2 is<br>putting in some work to ask a few questions about the research that you’d like to<br>do. Level 3 is when you have done a deep literature dive and found a problem<br>area specifically that you want to tackle. That is awesome, but by no means required<br>(I got <em>barely</em> to Level 2 in my statements). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, these are some guidelines for writing a good SoP. I’m attaching the SoP I<br>wrote for graduate school here, primarily because I found that there was a lack of<br>SoPs available when I was applying to graduate school in CS. I have tons of other<br>thoughts that I don’t have time to write down here, so I’ll just leave it at that.<br>If you have questions, feel free to email me at dkumar11@illinois.edu. </p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>I have been working a lot on my professional profile the last few weeks, primarily<br>because I’m gearing up to submit an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">NSF GRFP application</a>.<br>Since the beginning of graduate school, I’ve been a bit wary of “professionalism” and<br>“doing professional things”, mostly because I think it makes you take yourself too seriously,<br>which I believe is bad for actually getting work done. That being said, being forced to do<br>so has been somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as it’s made me focus a lot on what exactly<br>I want to do. </p>
<p>Two things are required for the NSF application. There’s a research proposal and a personal<br>statement. I’ll talk about how each has helped me in the last few weeks.</p>
<p><em>The research proposal:</em> </p>
<p>This piece is simple in theory—write a proposal on some research you’re planning on doing.<br>In practice, this is much harder to do. It’s easy to get bogged down with 10 million ideas, but<br>NSF isn’t asking for 10 million, they’re asking for one. It’s helped me really narrow my focus,<br>and think critically about one problem I’d like to tackle and how I plan to tackle that one problem.<br>For me, this was awesome. I love thinking of tons of problems and hackney solutions to those problems<br>, but rarely spend time to focus on how to solve just one thing really techincally, let alone write it<br>on a piece of paper. Even if my ideas don’t pan out, it’s definitely a skill that a grad student should<br>get better at, and I feel I’ve gotten better at is in the last few weeks. Yay, personal growth. In addition,<br>the prompts mandate that you pull out both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of your work, which<br>I believe are the cornerstone to any scientific endeavor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant" target="_blank" rel="external">Pasteur agrees with me</a>).<br>You should start thinking about how your research fits into these categories broadly, as they<br>will help shape the end results of your research. At least, I think so.</p>
<p><em>The personal statement</em></p>
<p>I hate writing about myself. A lot of my friends in academia <em>also</em> hate writing about themselves. That<br>makes the personal statement a special kind of hellish request. 3 pages of “I’m awesome” is enough to really<br>bring me down. That being said, I think there’s a way to write about yourself in a way that doesn’t<br>come off as totally boorish. At least, I hope so, since I employed that technique to write my<br>personal statement! </p>

        <p>My advisor told me yesterday my academic writing was annoying. In a quest to<br>be a better writer, I am mostly documenting this as a set of notes for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t try too hard. I am a mega culprit of this, and often use words that,<br>while they sound cool, offer little meaning to the sentence.</li>
<li>Never overstate. Science is about just presenting what you’ve done. </li>
<li>Verb choice is really important.</li>
<li>Stop using passive voice. I use lots of passive voice in my first drafts of<br>things, and it just leads to bad writing. Utilize the “by zombies” trick when you<br>are in doubt. (<a href="http://auwritingcenter.blogspot.com/2012/10/identify-passive-voice-with-zombies.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://auwritingcenter.blogspot.com/2012/10/identify-passive-voice-with-zombies.html</a>)</li>
<li>Avoid statements that don’t add anything. In the context of a paper about social media being used to<br>identify disinformation campsigns, a sentence like “Social media is the new frontier for disinformation campaigns”<br>is a terrible sentence. It doesn’t add anything to the writing.</li>
</ol>

        <p>I just submitted the last paper that I started during my first year, so I am<br>officially deeming my first year as done. Now that it’s over, I’m writing<br>this down to reflect on how the year has gone, and hope that my musings may<br>help you (the reader) as you navigate your first year as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Imposter syndrome is real. It takes a long time to get used to being “in charge”<br>of research and being an academic peer that professors will listen to. Don’t let it<br>hamper your curiosity.</li>
<li>Find an advisor that you can be friends with. Some people prefer<br>“professional relationships with their advisor”—but I can’t imagine what my first<br>year would be like if my advisor didn’t act like a friend to me from day 1.</li>
<li>Make friends with your labmates. If they are shy, force them to be your friend.<br>A good group culture leads to better discussions which leads to better ideas and<br>as a result, better research. It’s only been one year, but I’m happy to call my lab<br>mates my close friends.</li>
<li>Show up in the lab, even if you aren’t doing anything valuable. You learn a lot<br>from others in your lab by just being there, and it sets up a good habit for<br>when you are going to be doing this all the time in future years.</li>
<li>Tell your advisor you want to start on research immediately. You never know<br>what projects are just sitting around waiting for people to do things on them.</li>
<li>(Controversial, I think) Pay attention only in the classes that matter to your<br>research, and do the minimum for everything else. More time on task for research<br>is the most important thing.</li>
<li>Jump on as many things as you can. Failure is okay, especially in your first<br>year. Find your breaking point, then adjust. </li>
<li>Have fun. Research is supposed to be fun, and so is grad school.</li>
</ol>
