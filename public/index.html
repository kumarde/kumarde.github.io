        <p>From: martinw@bigmoviecompany.com<br>To: all-staff@bigmoviecompany.com<br>Subject: We Need To Make Some Changes in 2019</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m going to cut right to the chase - we are in deep shit. I just got the<br>initial numbers back from accounting, and our latest film, “Homeward Bound<br>VIII: A Dog’s Metaphysical Journey Through Zen and Back Again” is a total flop.<br>We only made $64 on opening weekend. We’re going to need to make some serious<br>changes to the way we do things or we’ll be bankrupt by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found an incredible opinion piece in The Hollywood Reporter that I’m<br>certain is going to guide us to success. It’s called “It’s Time to Retire the<br>Phrase Diversity is Good for Business” by Rebecca Sun. I vision quested on this<br>for a while, and I’ve come to the following conclusion – Rebecca is right,<br>because in fact, diversity is no longer good for business. </p>
<p>Consider “Black Panther”. This was the highest grossing film of the year - you<br>would expect that if diversity truly played a role in this, then the cast would<br>be exceptionally diverse, right? Wrong. Of the 22 cast members that show up<br>when you Google for the cast of the film, only two races appear. Can you<br>imagine! A movie with only two races! Even more shockingly, 19 of the 22 cast<br>members, or 87%, were exactly the same race. That means “Black Panther” scores<br>a dismal 13% on our in-house diversity index.</p>
<p>Repeat the same exercise for the movie “Crazy Rich Asians”, which grossed 240<br>million dollars this year, and you’ll find an even more startling result. Every<br>single cast member that shows up is Asian, which makes for a diversity index<br>score of 0%. Not a single other race was even considered for any roles in the<br>film. Now, look – I understand that there are a lot of different races in Asia.<br>But insofar as our extremely complex diversity index scoring algorithm goes,<br>all Asians pretty much look the same.</p>
<p>The lesson here is crystal clear: films with low diversity scores are the<br>secret to massive box office success. To incorporate this insight, all new<br>films produced by us will be single-race movies. How are we going to choose the<br>race for each movie, you ask? Well, I think we can all agree that<br>representation matters. And given that we are an American company, I think the<br>best way to choose is to pick a race modeled off of America’s population. So<br>that’s 72.4% White, 12.6% Black and 4.8% Asian. If 2018 is any indication,<br>nobody really cares about the other 10.1%.</p>
<p>In addition, we’ll be remaking some of the most popular movies in the last few<br>years to capitalize on this opportunity. Our shortlist includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An all-Asian version of “Black Panther” called “Yellow Panther”. Jackie Chan<br>will play the lead – a half human, half transformer – so you know we’ll capture<br>the entirety of the Chinese market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An all-Black version of “Crazy Rich Asians” called “Crazy and Rich Blacks”,<br>because if Kanye West taught us anything, it’s that audiences love to see rich<br>black men do and say ridiculous things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An all-White version of “12 Years a Slave” called “12 Years a Slave Owner”, to<br>capture the Neo-Nazi Confederate audience that’s been growing strong right here<br>in America.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hollywood is changing. We’ve gotta stay with it if we’re going to stay alive in<br>this dog eat dog world. Let’s make sure that 2019 is the least diverse year<br>Hollywood has ever seen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sincerely,<br>Martin Whiteman<br>Executive Producer</p>

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Are you tired of living in a political echo chamber? Do you feel beleaguered by<br>the fact that you can’t relate to 50% of the population? You don’t know a<br>single person who voted for “the other candidate?”</p>
<p>Look no further! Left/Right, the only dating app that pairs left wingers with<br>right wingers, is here!</p>
<p>Left/Right is built on a simple principle guided by centuries of deep<br>philosophical research. Storied gay activist and Beatles ghostwriter Albus<br>Dumbledore put it best: “All you need is love… making.”</p>
<p>Left/Right’s state of the art matching algorithm matches you with a partner who<br>is exactly opposed to you on every issue. Pro-Choice? Here’s a hot piece of<br>Pro-Life ass you just can’t say no to. Think the second amendment should be<br>abolished? Well, this guy you just matched with has 14 shotguns - and only 13<br>of them can kill (the last one is his penis).</p>
<p>Now, you may be concerned that being paired with someone from the other side<br>may increase risk of harm, death threats, or even violence. Our data suggests<br>otherwise. Only 7% of the conversations on Left/Right ended in reported1<br>threats of violence. That’s significantly lower than that of Tinder (14%),<br>Bumble (11%), and ClownDating.com (58%)!</p>
<p>In fact, conversations on Left/Right are so electrifying, they last longer and<br>often go further than more “traditional” dating apps. The dialogue is so<br>engaging that the rate of ghosting is near zero as you try to prove your moral<br>and intellectual superiority. In 86% of cases - and you’ll love this - this<br>ends in passionate, angry sex, which we all know is the best kind. More than<br>85,000 couples have been matched on the platform.</p>
<p>Success Stories:</p>
<p>Martha, a 26 year old MAGA true believer, had this to say:</p>
<p>“After the tariffs that were totally orchestrated by the Chinese destroyed my<br>soybean farm, I needed someone to blame. I hopped on Left/Right, and within 44<br>seconds I was in a chatroom with Brad, a die-hard liberal raised on a marijuana<br>farm in Colorado. We argued for 14 straight hours that day, then met up later<br>for some excellent foreplay (I’m saving myself for marriage, thank you very<br>much). We’ve been dating for six months. I’ve never been happier.”</p>
<p>Alex, a 23 year old Antifa member, provided these thoughts:</p>
<p>“I’ve found three partners on Left/Right, all of whom I personally tear gassed<br>at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. I can say is…  who could<br>have guessed that Nazi girls kept it so tight? Shout out to my Tomi Lahren<br>lookin’ babes.”</p>
<p>Shayla, 25, a down the line “moderate”, shared her feelings:</p>
<p>“I used to think that finding love in today’s world would be impossible if I<br>didn’t have strong political feelings - I mean, just look at what happened to<br>Taylor Swift! But with Left/Right, I’m paired with people who are just as<br>apathetic about politics as I am. I met my current boyfriend on the app, and<br>we’re a perfect match. We spend our weekends avoiding society, staring at blank<br>walls, and yelling at the neighbors cat.”</p>

        <p>I.</p>
<p>In my third week as a graduate student, my advisor walked into the office angry. He pointed at me and proclaimed: “You!”</p>
<p>I thought I was toast. Had I screwed up an experiment? My data was horribly<br>wrong? I committed academic malpractice? My imposter syndrome was raging in my<br>mind: “You don’t belong here. You don’t belong here. You don’t belong here.” </p>
<p>Then, after a moment of tension, he discloses his frustration: “I’m pronouncing<br>your name wrong. I’ve been pronouncing it wrong this whole time.”</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>My name is Deepak. And though it rings in at a mere two syllables, it has given<br>most Americans trouble to pronounce.</p>
<p>I picked up on this as early as Kindergarten. I didn’t have a name like “Jimmy<br>Smith” or “John Jacobs”. To fit in, I needed to let the masses call me whatever<br>they wanted. In my brief 24 years on this earth, I’ve gone by “Dee pahk”, “Dee<br>pack”, “Deep ka”, “Deek pa”, and on one occasion, “Dank pa”, which is what I<br>hope my unborn children will unironically call me someday.</p>
<p>For most of my childhood, I accepted these mispronunciations as an unyielding<br>reality. I convinced myself that my classmates and teachers would never<br>pronounce my name correctly. Any attempt to remedy their failings would be<br>futile. It was my problem, not theirs. So, I leaned all the way in. I started<br>introducing myself as “Dee pahk” to everyone. I did what so many other first<br>generation immigrants feel that they must do - ditch their given names and<br>muddy their culture just to fit in.</p>
<p>III. </p>
<p>“I looked at your Facebook profile. You have a pronunciation of your name<br>there. And it is not what I have been doing. Now teach me the right version. We<br>can’t be friends if I don’t know how to pronounce your name correctly.”</p>
<p>My whole life, I felt like shedding my name was the path to fitting in.  And<br>now, of all people, my 47-year-old white man advisor was shaming me because of<br>it. After a moment of incredulity, I looked at him and said: “It’s Dhee puck.<br>Like, the hockey puck”. And he got it on the first try.</p>
<p>Now, when I meet new people, I choose “Dhee puck” instead of “Dee pahk”.<br>Honestly? Most people still don’t get it. That’s okay - a rose by another name<br>is just as sweet.</p>
<p>Besides, fitting in is overrated anyway.</p>

        <p>You know what I could really go for right now? Bubble tea.</p>
<p>I look at the clock. What time is it? 9:48. Shit. Nothing’s going to be open.<br>It’s South Bay. Everything closes at 9.</p>
<p>I do a quick Google search. Bubble Tea Sunnyvale. There’s one result: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tea Zone - Mountain View: Open Until 11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scoooore. But wait, there’s a problem: I don’t leave the house after 8PM.</p>
<p>I get hit with a wave of inertia around then. Maybe it’s because it gets cold<br>and dark outside really quickly. Or maybe it’s because I’m lazy. Who knows.<br>Either way, I have two options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t leave, finish that laundry you’ve been putting off, then go to sleep.</li>
<li>Leave, brave the cold, acquire bubble tea, die in eternal happiness.</li>
</ol>
<p>I weigh these two options very carefully. It’s 9:52 now. I could spend an<br>eternity basking in the indecision. </p>
<p>But you know what? I could use a little spontenaiety. Fuck it. We eatin’<br>tonight.</p>
<p>So I put on some pants and a t-shirt (after which there is no turning back) and<br>embark on my quest. The first thing I notice? It’s quiet outside. Reaaaal<br>quiet. Almost too quiet. A night-creature (squirrel? opossum?) rustles a bush<br>right outside my apartment building. That rustle serves as a reminder that I<br>am not the only living being in South Bay.</p>
<p>Google Maps tells me it’ll take me seven minutes to walk there. I begin the<br>trek. It’s not a terribly exciting trip, but there’s something about being<br>alone that forces you to pay closer attention to the details around you.<br>How the tree branches extend in the darkness. How the Safeway logo<br>simultaneously looks like an S and a winding road. How no one appears to be going<br>southbound on El Camino Real at this hour.</p>
<p>Eventually, I reach The Tea Zone. Google did not lie - they were open. In fact,<br>maybe too open. Twelve others pack the small storefront, all itching to get<br>their late night bubble tea fix. But no one is ordering. Everyone just stares<br>up at the menu, weighing their options. Small? Medium? Regular? Taro? Boba?<br>Mango Jelly?</p>
<p>The clerk says she can help whoever is next. All eyes turn to me.</p>
<p>“Uh, you can go. We don’t know what we want yet.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t know what I want either. But the opportunity for spontenaeity<br>is thrust upon me, so I grab it.</p>
<p>I confidently walk up to the clerk. I will have…</p>
<p>Then, there’s a moment of pause. So many options. I can feel my<br>natural instincts kick in. I shake it off.</p>
<p>“I’ll have a regular milk tea, medium, with boba please.” </p>
<p>Phew. What a whirlwind. I never make a decision that quickly. </p>
<p>“How sweet would you like it? 25%? 50%? 75%? 100%?”</p>
<p>Oh god. Decisions. Nooooooooo! I shake it off again.</p>
<p>“50% please”.</p>
<p>The exchange is done in about 32 seconds. But unbeknownst to the clerk, I have<br>just performed a herculean task, for great reward. And for it, I must pay a<br>heavy price. </p>
<p>The price is… four dollars. Why does milk tea cost four dollars?</p>
<p>I collect the sweet sweet tea (okay, it was half sweet), then return home.<br>I can’t help but smile. It’s a beautiful night. I have bubble tea. And<br>the best part? I tried something new.</p>
<p>Who cares if it’s the most basic thing on the menu?</p>

        <p>The following post has <strong><em>MAJOR</em></strong> spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War.<br>Do not read if you haven’t seen the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War was a real treat. I found myself highly enjoying the<br>action, the humor, and the last ten years of superheroes all sharing the screen<br>together. </p>
<p>Though there were lots of parts I loved about the movie, what makes the story<br>especially excellent is Thanos. Here is a villain for whom most MCU fans have<br>been patiently waiting since we saw glimpses of him at the end of the first<br>Avengers film. And yet, in Infinity War, it isn’t his <em>villainy</em> that makes him<br>a powerful adversary (though he <em>is</em> an excellent villain). Instead, it’s how<br>the screenwriters, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, walk us through the<br>narrative from <em>Thanos’</em> perspective, giving us emotional insight that has<br>previously only been ascribed to the heroes in this universe. Reminding us what<br>Thanos has had to lose in order to achieve his goal of eliminating half the<br>universe to end suffering makes his plight all that more relatable.<br>In my opinion, it makes him the protagonist. </p>
<p>In most conventional stories on screen, you can follow the main character<br>through something called the “Hero’s Journey”: this is the cycle of events that<br>drive the plot and make the character who they are. Dan Harmon, the<br>screenwriter behind Commmunity, lays it out in 8 simple steps<br><a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A character is in a zone of comfort,</li>
<li>But they want something.</li>
<li>They enter an unfamiliar situation,</li>
<li>Adapt to it,</li>
<li>Get what they wanted,</li>
<li>Pay a heavy price for it,</li>
<li>Then return to their familiar situation,</li>
<li>Having changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I found was remarkable in this story is that there’s really only one<br>character who experiences a full journey of this kind so explicitly: Thanos.<br>Thanos exists in the universe, but he’s plagued by the suffering he saw<br>overpopulation bring to his home. Driven by this, he travels to planets around<br>the universe, non-discrimantly killing half the inhabitants in an act of what<br>he deems as charity. But it’s brutal, and Thanos himself acknowledges it. What<br>he wants is a <em>merciful</em> way to eliminate half the universe. And so begins his<br>quest to collect all of the Infinity Stones—together, they can remove half<br>the universe with the snap of a finger. It’s mercy, he says. </p>
<p>To do so, he needs to fight off a whole new set of adversaries: The Avengers<br>(and friends). Thanos is all powerful, but that doesn’t stop the Avengers from<br>getting in a couple of pretty awesome beatdowns. This is something he needs to<br>learn how to adapt to.  The really important part, however, is not just<br>figuring out how to beat the crap out of each of the avengers, but instead, how<br>identifying how to to acquire the soul stone, which hadn’t appeared in any<br>previous movies. In order to do so, he learns, he must sacrifice something he<br>truly loves. A soul for a soul. </p>
<p>Through this sacrifice, we see not only the price that Thanos must pay<br>(everything, as he succinctly says at the end of the movie), but also his<br>fundamental character change. He is wraught with anguish and grief at the<br>thought of killing his daughter in his plight to save the universe. However, he<br>proclaims that he has turned from his destiny before (he was not strong enough<br>to do something like this in the psat) and that he will not let that happen<br>again (he has changed). He kills Gamora, receiving the soul<br>stone in return, putting him steady on the path to Universal annihilation.<br>By the end of the movie, he’s returned back to the universe, having changed,<br>and succeeding in his major goal.</p>
<p>As far as stories go, this is actually pretty basic. It follows very closely<br>what an audience would expect to happen. But the <em>reason</em> it’s shocking is<br>because Thanos isn’t the “hero”. He’s the villain. And this is what brings me<br>back to why I think this movie was excellent—the filmmakers subverted my<br>expectations through the entire movie by making a movie that was actually not<br>about the Avengers at all, but instead about a distraught Titan simply trying<br>to make right in the universe.</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>I recently had a great conversation with a friend, <a href="http://jminjie.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Jordan Liu</a><br>about art and why we choose to make it.  </p>
<p>Context: For the last year or so, Jordan and I have been working on a musical.<br>As we were wrapping up our writing session for the day, we got into a<br>conversation about what we were going to do with it once it was “finished”.<br>Neither of us have “sold” a lengthy project like a musical before, so we spent<br>some time discussing how easy or difficult we thought that process would be. </p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="external">this idea</a>, Jordan<br>suggested he would be more satisfied if we reached 1000 true fans that would<br>“spend $100 on us” rather than reaching a million people who were less<br>invested. At first, I thought that this was totally at odds with my idea about<br>where I wanted the musical to go. In my mind, there was no question. Of course<br>I would prefer one million people to engage with my art over 1000 people! Who<br>wouldn’t?</p>
<p>Then, Jordan really got me thinking. What good would it do if a million people<br>saw our story but got nothing from it? Wouldn’t it actually be much better to<br>have 1000 people who it truly, deeply impacted? After all, we make art to do<br>just that - engage with people as humans, not as numbers. Well, wait. Now I’m<br>confused. Why is it that I make art? </p>
<p>Typically, the reasons for why I work on something is because I think it can<br>change the world (yes, I understand that sounds naive and silly, but it’s how I<br>think about things!) Well, in what ways can art change the world? It could<br>certainly entertain people. That’s one way. But does that really help “move the<br>needle forward” on the things that plague our society today, like too many mass<br>shootings or racial injustice? Probably not. However, I do like to tell myself<br>that it <em>can</em> help, maybe in ways that are unseen. </p>
<p>Take the example of the TV show “Atlanta”. To me, Atlanta is a delightfully<br>humanist look into the lives of black people <em>just living</em>. This is a<br>remarkably simple idea, but one with so much power - in my mind, if Atlanta can<br>build empathy with average Americans about how black people live and go<br>through relatable struggles, maybe, just maybe, <em>that</em> will improve race<br>relations in this country. But of course, saying that out loud makes me feel<br>like a total idiot. Of course TV can’t fix racism. Suggesting that it can<br>trivializes hundreds of years of brutal mistreatment of PoCs in this country.</p>
<p>Back to the question. If my art doesn’t <em>really</em> help anyone, then what’s the<br>point? Why do I insist that it must be created, engaged with, seen, critiqued,<br>and made better? Part of me knows it’s honestly just because I find it fun, and<br>we all like doing things that are fun for us. Another part of me yearns for<br>there to be a deeper reason. Who knows? I haven’t figured it out yet. In the<br>meanwhile, I’ll keep making stuff. Maybe someday it’ll <em>really</em> change the<br>world.</p>

        <p>My group recently had a “retreat”, where we sat around and talked to eachother<br>about lab culture and where we wanted to go next. I thought it was a really<br>insightful discussion, and reminded me of some of the things that contribute to<br>my very productive and happy research environment. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>My advisor is almost always available. Unlike many other advisors, Bailey<br>makes sure he is always around to talk about research. In fact, he’s<br>taken it to the extreme. He’s foregone his office and converted it into a lab<br>conference room, and sits in the lab with us every day. It keeps him closer to<br>the research, and more importantly, closer to us as graduate students. A lot<br>of graduate students have advisors who hole themselves up in their offices,<br>and as a result feel nervous and anxious during meetings with them. With this<br>strategy, there’s literally no walls between me and my advisor. People may think<br>this is insane, but I think it’s helped me a lot in keeping me honest about my<br>progress. It’s also somewhat reassuring to see that professors slack off too<br>sometimes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Technical debates, regardless of your status in the lab, don’t leave you feeling<br>like you’re stupid. This is in part because my advisor welcomes debate - in fact,<br>he often says that the day that you have an argument with him about a graph and win<br>is the day he knows you’re ready to graduate. However, these aren’t hostile in any<br>way - they’re all productive and espouse a culture of growth rather than a culture<br>of shame. This is something the graduate students try to do a good job of to, and<br>make for a really welcoming educational environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have fun. Last Friday, 4 members of my lab picked up a number of rubber ducks<br>and tried to juggle them. Why? I dunno. But it was fun. In a time where most of<br>your life is your work, having an environment where the coworkers work<br>and play hard is really important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We work in an open environment. There are no cubes. Hell, there aren’t even<br>desks. We come in, grab a spot, and get to work. There are quiet offices where we<br>can escape the bustle of the lab if we need as well, but having that open space<br>really helps facilitate great discussion and also keeps everyone keenly aware of<br>what everyone else is working on, by virtue of overhearing random research<br>conversations. </p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>I’ve spent a sizable amount of time in the last year and half writing. This is<br>par for the course for any graduate student—if you want to share your<br>research with the world, you’ll need to write about it. Since ~May of 2017,<br>however, I’ve also gotten into creative writing by way of writing screenplays<br>and stage plays. This has doubled the amount of writing I find myself doing.<br>I’ve noticed that there’s a really interesting structural connection between<br>academic writing and creative writing, at least in the context of writing for<br>the screen.</p>
<p>One of the most important rules in storytelling is making it very clear what<br>each character’s <em>intention</em> is.  In other words, what is it that the character<br>wants? You need to be very clear about this up front, or you’ll have a hard<br>time getting any viewer or reader excited about what the character does next.<br>In the same sense, with technical writing, you need to be very explicit about a<br><em>problem</em> that exists, and how your research addresses that problem. I’ve read<br>tons of papers in the last year, and while you can write a good paper without<br>being incredibly explicit about the problem up front, you won’t write a great<br>paper this way. The best papers are the ones that give me a fantastic sense for<br>the problem up front, and are very clear about how the research will solve that<br>problem. The researchers will present the challenges associated with doing said<br>research (i.e., obstacles to the character as they try to achieve their goals),<br>and culminates with results of the research (a character experiences growth as<br>a result of their journey). I think this is an interesting way to approach<br>writing academic work, and conversely, a nice structural way to analyze<br>screenplays. It’s definitely started helping me in my work. </p>

        <p>It’s almost December, so it’s about that time that people kick<br>it into high gear to apply to graduate school. I’ve had a few of my<br>close friends reach out to me and ask me to review their statements of<br>purpose, to which I told them they were crazy for trusting me to know<br>such a thing. But then again, that’s what I did two years ago to my<br>2nd year PhD friends, so maybe it’s not so crazy. I’m writing this to<br>compile a list of thoughts I had on writing statement for graduate school<br>applications.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The “Statement of Purpose” is aptly named - it is a statement of<br>your purpose. What is it that you want to do? And implicit to<br>that question, <em>why</em> is it that you want to do it? Consider this<br>as your thesis statement for your argument. For example, “I want to do a PhD<br>so I can become a professor that does research in X”. Alternatively,<br>“I want to do an MS to position myself better for Y job”. Every sentence<br>you write afterwards needs to build to that point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t tell people that you’ve been in love with your subject since you were<br>a young lassie (really, I’ve read something like this). It’s cliche and<br>people will instantly throw your statement away. Get right to the point<br>and state your purpose in the first sentence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware that most statements get looked at for maybe 3 minutes, max.<br>There are a lot of great applicants, and professors have fairly limited<br>time. You want to make sure that if someone is skimming your statement<br>quickly, they can pull out the important points fairly easily. I like<br>to do this by having the first sentence of each paragraph immediately say<br>what the point of that paragraph will be, without forcing the reader to tease<br>out the details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Mostly for Research Statements:</em> Make sure it is clear what you want to<br>do research in. Level 1 is simply saying you want to do research. Level 2 is<br>putting in some work to ask a few questions about the research that you’d like to<br>do. Level 3 is when you have done a deep literature dive and found a problem<br>area specifically that you want to tackle. That is awesome, but by no means required<br>(I got <em>barely</em> to Level 2 in my statements). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, these are some guidelines for writing a good SoP. I’m attaching the SoP I<br>wrote for graduate school here, primarily because I found that there was a lack of<br>SoPs available when I was applying to graduate school in CS. I have tons of other<br>thoughts that I don’t have time to write down here, so I’ll just leave it at that.<br>If you have questions, feel free to email me at dkumar11@illinois.edu. </p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>I have been working a lot on my professional profile the last few weeks, primarily<br>because I’m gearing up to submit an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">NSF GRFP application</a>.<br>Since the beginning of graduate school, I’ve been a bit wary of “professionalism” and<br>“doing professional things”, mostly because I think it makes you take yourself too seriously,<br>which I believe is bad for actually getting work done. That being said, being forced to do<br>so has been somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as it’s made me focus a lot on what exactly<br>I want to do. </p>
<p>Two things are required for the NSF application. There’s a research proposal and a personal<br>statement. I’ll talk about how each has helped me in the last few weeks.</p>
<p><em>The research proposal:</em> </p>
<p>This piece is simple in theory—write a proposal on some research you’re planning on doing.<br>In practice, this is much harder to do. It’s easy to get bogged down with 10 million ideas, but<br>NSF isn’t asking for 10 million, they’re asking for one. It’s helped me really narrow my focus,<br>and think critically about one problem I’d like to tackle and how I plan to tackle that one problem.<br>For me, this was awesome. I love thinking of tons of problems and hackney solutions to those problems<br>, but rarely spend time to focus on how to solve just one thing really techincally, let alone write it<br>on a piece of paper. Even if my ideas don’t pan out, it’s definitely a skill that a grad student should<br>get better at, and I feel I’ve gotten better at is in the last few weeks. Yay, personal growth. In addition,<br>the prompts mandate that you pull out both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of your work, which<br>I believe are the cornerstone to any scientific endeavor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant" target="_blank" rel="external">Pasteur agrees with me</a>).<br>You should start thinking about how your research fits into these categories broadly, as they<br>will help shape the end results of your research. At least, I think so.</p>
<p><em>The personal statement</em></p>
<p>I hate writing about myself. A lot of my friends in academia <em>also</em> hate writing about themselves. That<br>makes the personal statement a special kind of hellish request. 3 pages of “I’m awesome” is enough to really<br>bring me down. That being said, I think there’s a way to write about yourself in a way that doesn’t<br>come off as totally boorish. At least, I hope so, since I employed that technique to write my<br>personal statement! </p>
