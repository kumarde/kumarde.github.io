Okay. Deep breath.

Lots has happened in the last year. I did my thesis proposal, officially making
me a PhD candidate with one foot out the door and an eye on graduation.  I
finally wrote that paper I've been thinking about writing since summer 2018.
We workshopped Baked! The Musical in Chicago in May 2019, and then put it on
for real for real at the Chicago Musical Theatre Festival, where it had a sold
out run. Jordan and I won best lyrics of the festival, and our cast won
literally every possible acting award (best lead, supporting performer,
best ensemble).  

While I wasn't doing any of that stuff, I climbed a bunch, made some great new
friends, and watched a season of Survivor in its fullest. I also made big
strides in my music theory knowledge, grew into composing music on guitar, and
wrote a bunch of poems and songs.

Another breath.

I'm really proud of all the things I've been able to accomplish in the last
year. Sometimes it was really hard to juggle musical theatre work with academic
work, and there were definitely some life things that slipped through the
cracks. I ate out a ton. Working out mostly took a backseat, except for once or
twice a week. But mostly – and this was honestly surprising to me – it was
okay! I was pretty sure that at some point in this process I would break. In
part, this is attributed to the great support system in my friends, family, and
coworkers. But it's partially due to the fact that I'm realizing that I can
literally do anything I want (if I have money), and no one will stop me. And
that is ridiculously energizing, empowering, and some other word that starts with e.

Final breath.

I'm really excited to commit even harder to my art this year and beyond. 2020
is off to a great start.
