I just submitted the last paper that I started during my first year, so I am 
officially deeming my first year as done. Now that it's over, I'm writing
this down to reflect on how the year has gone, and hope that my musings may
help you (the reader) as you navigate your first year as well.

1. Imposter syndrome is real. It takes a long time to get used to being "in charge"
of research and being an academic peer that professors will listen to. Don't let it
hamper your curiosity.
2. Find an advisor that you can be friends with. Some people prefer
"professional relationships with their advisor"---but I can't imagine what my first
year would be like if my advisor didn't act like a friend to me from day 1.
3. Make friends with your labmates. If they are shy, force them to be your friend.
A good group culture leads to better discussions which leads to better ideas and 
as a result, better research. It's only been one year, but I'm happy to call my lab
mates my close friends.
4. Show up in the lab, even if you aren't doing anything valuable. You learn a lot
from others in your lab by just being there, and it sets up a good habit for 
when you are going to be doing this all the time in future years.
5. Tell your advisor you want to start on research immediately. You never know 
what projects are just sitting around waiting for people to do things on them.
6. (Controversial, I think) Pay attention only in the classes that matter to your 
research, and do the minimum for everything else. More time on task for research 
is the most important thing.
7. Jump on as many things as you can. Failure is okay, especially in your first
year. Find your breaking point, then adjust. 
8. Have fun. Research is supposed to be fun, and so is grad school.
