I just submitted the last paper that I started during my first year, so I am 
officially deeming my first year to be done. Now that it's over, I'm writing
this down to reflect on how the year has gone, and hope that my musings may
help you (the reader) as you navigate your first year as well.

Being a new PhD student is really hard.
