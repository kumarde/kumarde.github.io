                    <p> This page is for students and trainees who are interested in working with me on research. The goal of the page is to serve as an informative guide to learn about my interests, the style of work I do best, and what you can expect from me as an advisor.</p>

                        <p> I conduct research at the intersection of security & privacy and human-computer interaction. I am currently interested in understanding how we build sociotechnical systems to be safer for people facing a host of adversarial threats, like online harassment and mis/disinformation. That being said, I am always open to chatting about ideas that are about the Internet (once the OS has booted) and would be happy to discuss those with you. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I am an <i>empiricist,</i> which means I like to study problems through observation, inference, and test. Practically, this means that a lot of what we'll be doing in my group is building systems to measure Internet phenomena, reasoning about study design, collecting and analyzing data (ranging from surveys + interviews to Internet scale measurements), and writing up our findings in clear and compelling narratives. 
                        </p>
                        <p>There are lots of terms for this style of work (Internet measurement? Data science? Social computing? Computational social science?) but at its core, the technical work will blend a deep systems expertise with a penchant for studying real-world problems where people are involved. If you are a theorist, I am likely not the advisor you are looking for.
                        </p>

                        <p> I love engaging with passionate students who come with opinions on the work we are conducting together, and I care deeply about fostering a respectful and collaborative advisor/advisee relationship. 

                        I am a communicative, hands-on advisor. 
                        and I love to get in-the-weeds about research. This doesn't mean I am going to build your measurement pipelines for you (I likely will not) but rather that I will  

                        I am a highly community-centered advisor. 

                        This means that I will, to the best of my ability, put  </p>
